## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is the :octocat: home of the [Miyo Reader](https://miyo-reader.io) project.

Its purpose is to build an **open** software/open hardware **ebook reader**.

### Expense Tracking
While software development effort is at least somewhat visible via the commit log other expenses incurred during the creation of a hardware product such as buying hardware for prototyping, software licenses, development tools, etc. are usually hidden. This income/expense list exists to make those expenses visible and to provide accountability for our sponsors.
| **Year** | **Income** / Year | [**Expenses**](https://github.com/miyo-reader/.github/tree/main/invoices) / Year | **Profit (+) / Loss (-)** |
